# React-Portfolio

This is my new portfolio page I created using React.js and an Express server. I have my new portfolio deployed to Heroku. You can view it by following this link: https://phillip-jones.herokuapp.com/#

## New Technologies

With a new portfolio, I decided to learn a couple of new technologies to set myself apart from others. 

### Canvas

On the landing page, you will see a matrix style cascading effect. That is all animated with the HTML5 Canvas element.

### Nodemailer

This is the technology I was really excited about. Instead of broadcasting my contact information for anyone to gather, I designed a form that sends me an email directly. I supplied email information using environmental variables so that my information could not be found in the source code as well.
